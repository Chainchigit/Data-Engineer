Hello,
This is a sample    text file.
	It contains multiple lines, different spacing,
and	some tabs.

This should be sanitized correctly!
Let's see how well it works.

Additional lines are added to test the functionality.
	Tabs should be replaced with underscores.
Line breaks should remain as they are.

This is a longer paragraph to check how the text sanitizer
handles large chunks of text. It should properly process and
clean all input data efficiently, regardless of size.

Another test line with multiple words and spaces     to see 
how well extra spaces are handled.

Finally, some numbers and symbols: 1234567890 !@#$%^&*()
